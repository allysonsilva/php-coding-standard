# Contributing

When contributing to this repository send a new **pull request**. If your change is big or complex, or you simply want to suggest an improvement, please discuss the change you wish to make via an **issue**.

## Pull Request Process / Guidelines

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [README.md](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- You may need to [**rebase**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Send a coherent commit history**, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
- **Create feature branches**.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
